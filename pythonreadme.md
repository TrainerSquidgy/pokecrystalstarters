**PYTHON STUFF**
The Python Script will automate *most* files, but not all.

You will still need to edit data/pokemon/evos_attacks.asm and manually input the Pok√©mon's moves.

You may want to edit data/pokemon/menu_icons.asm to give the correct menu icon.

You may want to edit gfx/footprints.asm to give footprints.
